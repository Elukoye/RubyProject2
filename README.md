# RubyProject2
# Advanced Building Blocks - Enumerables
[Solo project]
In this project, you will implement your own version of Rubyâ€™s enumerable methods. Full task description: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks.

# As this is a solo project:
Each member of the team should submit both, a separate Code Review Requests and a Project Completion Form.
Once you are finished with this project, continue working together with your coding partner on the next project.
You must still remain in a video call with your partner during your independent work.
